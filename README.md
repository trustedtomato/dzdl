# dzdl
Download music through Deezer from the command-line.

## Prerequisites
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must be installed.
The program can only be used through the command-line, so you'll need some kind of terminal emulator.
MacOS, Linux and Windows (PowerShell) have it built-in,
but on Android you have to install additional software (I use Termux).

## Install
1. Clone this git respository.
2. `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `npm install --global`.
4. `cd` into your music directory and start downloading music using `dzdl` (see `dzdl --help` for specific options).

## Bugs
If you find a bug, please firstly `cd` into the directory and try updating the respository via `npm run update`;
if the bug still remains, file an issue here.
